Main file the boiler firmware. The boiler firrmware is intended for temperature characterizations. 2 modes are possible, verifier(\+V) and prover(\+P). The verifier is sending continously frames, and the prover turns on reception intermittently according to a given Duty Cycle. The Duty Cycle can be set by changing the sleep\+\_\+time variable (= sleep time between two receptions) of the device. The default sleep\+\_\+time when the device is turned on is defined in S\+L\+E\+E\+P\+\_\+\+T\+I\+ME. Otherwise this parameter can be changed though the serial port. Send \textquotesingle{}1\mbox{[}new\+\_\+sleep\+\_\+time\mbox{]}\textquotesingle{} to modify the value. Send \textquotesingle{}0\textquotesingle{} to both P and V to start a boiling process; the prover will switch to a duty cyle of 100\% for a maiximum temeprature gradient. See the platform documentation and related papers for details.
